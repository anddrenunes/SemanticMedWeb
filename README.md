What is the SemanticMedWeb?
===========================
The SemanticMedWeb (SMW) is more of a concept than a specific implementation. 
The concept is based on integration of diverse applications via a mechanism to exchange both the syntactic as well as semantic contexts of any healthcare related concept. 


SemanticMedWeb Demo 1.0
=======================

This is an example application built on top of eXist-DB. 
The data instances were created using the instance generator from HKCR.net
based on CCDs from the CCD-Gen generator. For question about the CCD-Gen contact @twcook on GitHub

The SemanticMedWeb, initially focused on patient clinical, demographic and admin data only.
As of June 1, 2013 we are collaborating with Translational Researchers to develop an approach to semantic integration with biomedical databases. This is a foundational problem in the Translational Medicine domain that this project based on Multi-Level Healthcare Inforamtion Modelling approaches can address with success.

SMW Installation
================

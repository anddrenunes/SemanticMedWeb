MLHIM EMR Demo
===============

This is an example application built on top of eXist-DB. 
The data instances were created using the instance generator from HKCR.net
Initially, a few basic queries have been added (see the modules folder). 

Installation
============
Install eXist 2.0 then import this as a new collection.
When the app is more mature we will produce an actual eXist application.

git wouldn't accept empty directories so the admin collection is in a ZIP file in the data collection. Uncompress thsi file before importing the code into eXist. 
TODO: Add some entries to all of the admin records. 


Next Steps
==========
Building XForms for the existing data and CCDs.
Wiring these as a web application.
Build more XForms based on new or existing CCDs from HKCR.net

Description: The basic metabolic panel (BMP) is used to check the status of a person's kidneys and their electrolyte and acid/base balance, as well as their blood glucose level. It can also be used to monitor hospitalized patients and people with certain known conditions, such as hypertension and hypokalemia. If a doctor is interested in following two or more individual BMP components, she may order the entire BMP because it offers more information. Alternatively, she may order individual tests when monitoring, such as a follow-up glucose, potassium, or calcium, or order an electrolyte panel to monitor sodium, potassium, chloride, and CO2. If a doctor wants more information, she may order a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP), a group of 14 tests that includes those in the BMP.
